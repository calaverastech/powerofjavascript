	| The objective of the game is to guess a sequence of colors randomly generated by the server. 
ol
	li 
		| The user selects options for the game - code (sequence) length and if duplicate colors are allowed in the sequence. The default options are those stored in the browser from the last game. If no game has been ever played, the default options are code length of 4 with no duplicate colors. 
	li 
		| When the user presses "New Game", the server generates a random sequence of colors according to the options selected by the user.
	li
		| The user can make their first guess dragging and dropping colored balls into the first row of the holes on the board. Choosing multiple balls of the same color is allowed. To change a color, drag and drop another ball into the same hole.
	li
		| After the row is filled with balls, the user presses "OK" button on the right. The browser will give a feedback in the small grid on the right. Each red ball means that one of the guessed balls belongs to the sequence and placed into a correct hole. Each white ball means that one of the guessed balls belongs to the sequence but placed into a wrong hole. The order of the red and white balls doesn't matter. The user learns from this feedback and plans their next step.
	li
		| The user repeats step 3 until they guess the sequence or all the rows are filled up. They can also select new options and press "New Game" at any time to reset the board and start a new game. 
	li
		| The game is over after the user guessed the sequence correctly or used up all the rows on the board. The correct sequence is shown on the top. If the user has won the game, they get congratulated.
